        <h3>About Resting Places</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Shay. This is my travel blog, Resting Places. I had your typical American childhood, with the strange quirk of living behind a cemetery. It never occured to me to find this creepy or sad, since I saw it every day from our living room window, and while I was out playing in our backyard. I think this early exposure to cemeteries has led me to see them as contemplative spaces where we honor those that have impacted our lives. I find that each new city I visit brings a new exposure to a culture's traditions about honoring and celebrating the lives of the dead, and I'm here to give you a little bit of that history-- from my home base in New York City to Europe, South America, and beyond. </p>
        <p>I hope you learn a little bit more about the traditions around death and honoring the lives of our loved ones. </p>
